WenMoon is a fork from the popular Safemoon with a couple differences. The token does not make use of liquidity locks, and instead has a 15% transaction fee which is entirely redistributed to wallet holders. The intention is to incentivize holding and reward holders/investors. We run manual burns at decreasing amounts every 100 wallet holders. There was no presale so as to offer a fair launch and to mitigate the fear of a quick pump and dump by presale holders. As for the WenMoon project as a whole, the focus is maturing from speculative meme coin to a long-term project focused on helping people hit the moon. We recently announced our Astronaut Program where we will be donating $1,000 every $1m increase in market cap focused on financial literacy. We are also working to launch our first of many Dapps which will have a freemium model with premium features powered by the WenMoon Token. The Dapp roadmap is focused on filling in software gaps in the defi space with particular focus around safe and informed investing.
